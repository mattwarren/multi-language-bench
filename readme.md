Here is the original description of this project:


    Standardized benchmarks, implemented in multiple languages, using the language's idiomatic, default containers, iteration methods, type methods and so. An effort to allow an almost fair comparison of core characteristics of the various languages.

    An initial comparison of a loop recognition algorithm, implemented in C++, Java, Go, and Scala, has been published at the Scala Days 2011 Workshop at Stanford: https://code.google.com/p/multi-language-bench/source/browse/trunk/doc/scaladays2011-paper/main.pdf 

What I would like to do is to implement the same algorithm in the languages I use (C#/F#/Ruby) and compare them with those listed in the paper.
